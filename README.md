# Analysis of Schools in San Diego Neighborhoods 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Introduction/Business Problem

I live in San Diego, CA.
So, i've decided to explore and analyze neighborhoods in this wonderful city to understand, is it any correlation between median household income and amount of schools in this neighborhood.

I found the great GeoJSON file from Zillow that consists of all USA Neighborhoods in USA, with latitude and longitude information. I filtered it to find all Neighborhoods in San Diego. Then scraped https://www.homesnacks.net/richest-neighborhoods-in-san-diego-129013/. This web page represents "List Of The Richest Neighborhoods In San Diego For 2020". After preprocessing the data, i started playing with Foursqure API to find out how many schools was in each neighborhood and then clustered them. 

The main question is:

# Does it mean that in the richest neighborhoods more and better schools than in Poorest Neighborhoods?.
