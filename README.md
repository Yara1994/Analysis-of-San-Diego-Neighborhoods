# Analysis-of-San-Diego-Neighborhoods

## Introduction/Business Problem

I live in San Diego, CA.
So, i've decided to explore and analyze neighborhoods in this wonderful city to understand the best area for succesful running diferent businesses.

I found the great GeoJSON file from Zillow that consists of all USA Neighborhoods in USA, with latitude and longitude information. I will filter it to find all Neighborhoods in San Diego. Then i will scrape https://www.homesnacks.net/richest-neighborhoods-in-san-diego-129013/. This web page represents "List Of The Richest Neighborhoods In San Diego For 2020". After preprocessing the data, i will start playing around with Foursqure API to undrestand which Neighborhoods are the best for succesful running diferent businesses.
